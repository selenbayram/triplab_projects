# Repository: triplab_projects 
(Summer 2023, TripLab)

This repository consists of the code written during June-August 2023 summer research training.

### Project: Cross-Modal Data Integration Using Seurat

#### Datasets
Allen Institute (smart-seq dataset with gene expression), Allen Institute (older datasets with electrophsiology data), and Gouwens (patch-seq dataset with both electrophysiology and gene expression)

#### Research Questions
1- Can we infer cell type identity (t-type) for cells for which only the electrophysiology data is available? <br />
2- Can we infer electrophysiological properties for cells using the gene expression data? <br />
3- Can we infer gene expression based on electrophysiology data on cells? <br />

#### Initial Steps for Learning
0- Set up VSCode and remote access to SCC; get correct versions of R and Seurat <br />
1- Perform clustering and UMAP analysis on mouse smart-seq dataset used for 2022 KCNI Summer School <br />
2- Perform clustering and UMAP analysis on Gouwens patch-seq dataset <br />
